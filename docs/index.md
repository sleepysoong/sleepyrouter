# Documentation Index

This directory is the maintained route map for `sleepy-llm-router`. Start here when deciding which files, research notes, and checks apply to a task.

## Repository at a glance

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What is this repo? | A TypeScript/Node local proxy named `slr` for routing coding-agent requests to selected free OpenRouter and NVIDIA models. |
| What does it expose? | OpenAI-compatible `/v1` and Anthropic-compatible `/anthropic` local surfaces on port `4567` by default. |
| How is it used? | Install globally, set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, configure selected models in `~/.sleepy-llm-router/config.json`, then run `slr start`. |
| Where is runtime behavior? | `src/cli.ts`, `src/commands/*`, `src/server/*`, `src/providers/*`, and `src/latency/*`. |
| Where are user instructions? | Root `README.md` for overview and `docs/INSTALLATION.md` plus localized mirrors for setup and commands. |

## Routes

| Task | Read | Research / decisions | Code anchors | Test anchors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider support | [Provider guide](provider-guide.md) | [Provider research](../research/providers.md) | `src/providers/*`, `src/server/create-server.ts` | `test/openrouter.test.ts`, `test/nvidia.test.ts`, `test/catalog.test.ts`, provider-related server tests |
| Routing | [Latency routing](latency-routing.md) | — | `src/latency/router.ts`, `src/server/create-server.ts` | `test/router.test.ts` |
| Client compatibility | [Client compatibility](client-compatibility.md) | [Client research](../research/client-compatibility.md) | `src/server/*`, `src/server/translate.ts` | `test/server.test.ts`, `test/translate.test.ts` |
| Product behavior | [Product notes](product.md) | [Research index](../research/index.md) | `src/cli.ts`, `src/commands/*`, `src/server/*` | User-visible command and API tests in `test/` |
| Architecture boundaries | [Architecture](architecture.md) | [Decision records](../research/decisions/README.md) | `src/config/*`, `src/providers/*`, `src/latency/*`, `src/server/*` | Layer-specific tests |

## Maintenance rules

- `README.md` is the root why-focused entry doc; setup and CLI reference live in [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md). Localized READMEs and installation guides also live under `docs/`; see `AGENTS.md` § "Multilingual user-facing docs" for update rules.
- Project-maintenance pages in `docs/` stay compact and route-oriented.
- `research/` stores reusable findings and decision records that are too detailed for route pages.
- Keep route/research documentation under `docs/` and `research/` in English. User-facing docs ship five languages.

## Validation

Run:

```bash
npm run docs:check
```

Expected coverage: required docs and research files exist, local markdown links resolve, route pages point to their code and test anchors, and maintained docs avoid stale or origin-focused wording.

## Update rule

Update this index whenever a top-level route, source anchor, test anchor, or research note becomes the preferred entry point. Keep entries short and move details to the linked page.
